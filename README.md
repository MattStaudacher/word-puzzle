## About

Word Puzzle
Create a website that uses a method to replace vowels in a string with the dash symbol "-" to create a word puzzle to solve. Hide the original string when you show the resulting word puzzle, so that another person can try and guess it.

Example:

String Input: "Believe you can and you're halfway there. Theodore Roosevelt"

Puzzle Output: "B-l--v- y-- c-n -nd y--'r- h-lfw-y th-r-. Th--d-r- R--s-v-lt"

Do this without "regular expressions".
